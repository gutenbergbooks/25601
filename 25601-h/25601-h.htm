<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In issuing this little book I have been actuated by a desire
to do something towards the removal of a lamentable degree of
popular ignorance.</p>

<p>It seems that no proposition that can be made is so absurd
or impossible but that many people, ordinarily regarded as
intelligent, will be found to accept it and to aid in its propagation.
And hence, when it is asserted that a young lady has
lived for fourteen years without food of any kind, hundreds
and thousands of persons throughout the length and breadth of
a civilized land at once yield their belief to the monstrous
declaration.</p>

<p>I have confined my remarks entirely to the question of
abstinence from food. The other supernatural gifts, the possession
of which is claimed, would, if considered, have extended
the limits of this little volume beyond the bounds which were
deemed expedient. At some future time I may be tempted to
discuss them. In the meantime it is well to call to mind that
a proposition (<i>see</i> <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>) which I made solely in the interest
of truth was disregarded, ostensibly with the desire to avoid
publicity, when in fact the daily press had for weeks been filled
with reports in detail, furnished by the friends of the young
lady in question, of the marvellous powers she was said to
possess.</p>

<p>A portion of this essay, which bore upon the matter discussed,
has been taken from another volume by the author, published
several years ago, and now out of print.</p>

<h1>FASTING GIRLS.</h1>

<h2>I.</h2>

<h3>ABSTINENCE IN THE MIDDLE AGES.</h3>

<p>Among the many remarkable manifestations by which hysteria
exhibits itself, for the astonishment of the credulous and
uneducated portion of the public, and&mdash;alas, that it should
have to be said,&mdash;for the delectation of an occasional weak-minded
and ignorant physician, the assumption of the ability
to live without food may be assigned a prominent place. I am
not aware that this power has been claimed in its fullest development
for the male of the human species. When he is
deprived of food he dies in a few days, more or less, according
to his physical condition as regards adipose tissue and strength
of constitution; but if a weak emaciated girl asserts that she
is able to exist for years without eating, there are at once certificates
and letters from clergymen, professors, and even physicians,
in support of the truth of her story. The element of
impossibility goes for nothing against the bare word of such a
woman, and her statements are accepted with a degree of confidence
which is lamentable to witness in this era of the world's
progress.</p>

<p>The class of deceptions occasionally induced by hysteria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and embracing these "fasting girls," has been known for many
years, though it is only in comparatively recent times that the
instances have been taken at their proper value. G&ouml;rres<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> gives
a number of examples occurring among male and female saints
and other holy persons, in which partial or total abstinence
from food was said to have existed for long periods.</p>

<p>Thus Liduine of Schiedam fell ill in 1395, and remained in
that state till her death, thirty-three years subsequently. During
the first nineteen years she ate every day nothing but a
little piece of apple the size of a holy wafer, and drank a little
water and a swallow of beer, or sometimes a little sweet milk.
Subsequently, being unable to digest beer and milk, she restricted
herself to a little wine and water, and still later she
was obliged to confine herself to water alone, which served her
both as food and drink. But after nineteen years she took
nothing whatever, according to her own statement made to
some friars in 1422, she averring that for eight years nothing in
the way of nourishment had passed her lips, and that for twenty
years she had seen neither the sun nor the moon, nor had
touched the earth with her feet.</p>

<p>Saint Joseph of Copertino remained for five years without
eating bread, and ten years without drinking wine, contenting
himself with dried fruits, which he mixed with various bitter
herbs. The herb which he used for Fridays had such an
atrocious taste, that one of the brethren, by simply putting
his tongue to it, was seized with vomiting, and for several days
thereafter everything he ate excited nausea. He fasted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
forty days seven times every year, and during these periods ate
nothing at all except on Sundays and Thursdays.</p>

<p>Nicolas of Flue, as soon as he embraced the monastic life,
subsisted altogether on the holy eucharist. The pious G&ouml;rres
in explanation of this miracle says:</p>

<p>"In ordinary nourishment he who eats being superior to
that which is eaten, assimilates the aliments which he takes,
and communicates to them his own nature. But in the eucharist
the aliment is more powerful than he who eats. It is
no longer therefore the nourishment which is assimilated, but
on the contrary, it assimilates the man, and introduces him into
a superior sphere. An entire change is produced. The supernatural
life in some way or other absorbs the natural life, and
the man instead of living on earth, lives henceforth by grace
and by heaven."</p>

<p>This is about on a par, as regards lucidity and logic, with the
explanations which we are given of the alleged case of prolonged
fasting in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Doubts arose in regard to Nicolas, and the bishop had him
watched, but without detecting him in fraud. Finally he ordered
him to eat a piece of bread in his presence. Nicolas did as he
was commanded, but at the first mouthful he was seized with
violent vomiting. The bishop inquired of him how he thus
managed to live without eating, to which the brother answered
that when he assisted at mass, and when he took the holy
eucharist, he felt a degree of strength and suppleness like that
derived from the most nutritious food.</p>

<p>Still the doubters continued, and the inhabitants of Underwold,
where Nicolas lived, appear to have been at first very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
much inclined to suspect him of deceit. But they were finally
converted, for having during a whole month guarded every
approach to his cabin, and having during that time detected
no one in taking food to him, they were convinced that for
that time at least he had lived without food. The sceptical
reasoner of the present day would probably regard the test as
insufficient.</p>

<p>In 1225, Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, having heard that there
was at Leicester a nun who had taken no nourishment for
seven years, and who lived only on the eucharist, which she
took every Sunday, gave at first no faith to the story. He sent
to her, however, fifteen clerks, with directions to watch her
assiduously for fifteen days, never for an instant losing sight
of her. The clerks reported to him that they had strictly
obeyed his commands; that she had taken no nourishment,
and that yet she nevertheless preserved her full strength and
health. Whereupon the Bishop declared himself convinced,
"as," adds G&ouml;rres, "it was proper for a sensible man to do."</p>

<p>Among others of the holy persons who acquired the power
of living on the sacramental bread, may be mentioned St.
Catharine of Sienna, Saint Rose of Lima, Saint Collete, Saint
Peter of Alcantara, and many others.</p>

<p>But if saints and other holy people were able, through
miraculous power, to live without food, the same ability was
claimed for those who were under the influence of demons and
devils. G&ouml;rres<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> states that a person possessed by a devil often
loses all taste for food of any kind, and can retain no nourishment
in his body. Another symptom is a disgust which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
formed for the companionship of other persons. Thus a man
was tormented by a demon, who forced him to fly into the
forests, where he hid himself from mankind. One night he
quit his house, and concealed himself in a cavern, remaining
there entirely without food for sixteen days. Again he remained
in the woods twenty-four days, neither eating nor
drinking during this period. Finally his children found him,
and taking him to a priest, had the devil exorcised, and he was
cured.</p>

<p>Saint Prosper, of Aquitaine, speaks of a young girl possessed
by a devil, and who went seventy days without eating.
Notwithstanding this long fast, she did not become emaciated,
because every night at twelve o'clock a bird sent by the devil
took a mysterious nourishment to her.</p>

<p>An astonishing feature in the cases of the diabolical abstaining
from food, is that, as in the holy instances, they exhibit
various manifestations of hysteria. G&ouml;rres, with a charming
degree of simplicity, details these symptoms and failing, under
the influence of the predominant idea which fills him, to recognize
their real character, ascribes them without hesitation to
devilish agency. Thus he says:</p>

<p>"The functions of the organs of nutrition are sometimes profoundly
altered in the possessed, and these alterations are manifested
by violent cramps, which show the extent to which the
muscular system is affected. The hysterical lump in the throat
is a frequent phenomenon in possession. A young girl in the
Valley of Calepino had all her limbs twisted and contracted,
and had in the &#339;sophagus a sensation as if a ball was sometimes
rising in her throat, and again falling to her stomach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Her countenance was of an ashen hue, and she had a constant
sense of weight and pain in the head. All the remedies of
physicians had failed, and as evidences of possession were
discovered in her, she was brought to Brignoli (a priest) who
had recourse to supernatural means, and cured her."</p>

<p>Strange to say, the ability to live on the eucharist, and to
resist starvation by diabolical power, died out with the middle
ages, and was replaced by the "fasting girls," who still continue
to amuse us with their vagaries. To the consideration
of some of the more striking instances of more recent times
the attention of the reader is invited, in the confidence
that much of interest in the study of the "History of
Human Folly" will be adduced.</p>

<h3>ABSTINENCE IN MODERN TIMES.</h3>

<p>Among the more striking cases under this head, is that
of Margaret Weiss, a young girl ten years of age, who
lived at Rode, a small village near Spires, and whose history
has come down to us through various channels, but principally
from Gerardus Bucoldianus,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who had the medical charge of
her, and who wrote a little book describing his patient.
Margaret is said to have abstained from all food and drink for
three years, in the meantime growing, walking about, laughing,
and talking like other children of her age. During the
first year, however, she suffered greatly from pains in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
her head and abdomen, and, a common condition in hysteria&mdash;all
four of her limbs were contracted. She passed neither
urine nor f&aelig;ces. Margaret, though only ten years old&mdash;hysteria
develops the secretive faculties&mdash;played her part so well
that, after being watched by the priest of the parish and Dr.
Bucoldianus, she was considered free from all juggling, and
was sent home to her friends by order of the King, "not," the
doctor adds, "without great admiration and princely gifts."
Although fully accepting the fact of Margaret's abstinence, Dr.
Bucoldianus appears to have been somewhat staggered, for he
asks very pertinently: "Whence comes the animal heat, since
she neither eats nor drinks, and why does the body grow when
nothing goes into it?"</p>

<p>Schenckius<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> quotes from Paulus Lentulus the "Wonderful
History of the Fasting of Appolonia Schreira, a virgin in
Berne." Lentulus states that he was with this maid on three
occasions, and that, by order of the magistrate of Berne, she
was taken to that city and a strict guard kept upon her. All
kinds of means were set in operation to detect imposture if
any existed, but none was discovered, and she was set at liberty
as a genuine case of ability to live without food. In the
first year of her fasting she scarcely slept, and in the second
year never closed her eyes in sleep; and so she continued for
a long while after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Schenckius also advances the case of Katharine Binder, of
the Palatinate, who was closely watched by a clergyman, a
statesman, and two doctors of medicine, without the detection
of fraud on her part. She was said to have taken nothing but
air into her system for nine years and more, as Lentulus reported
on the authority of Fabricius. This last-named physician
told Lentulus of another case, that of a girl fourteen years old,
who certainly had taken neither food nor drink for at least
three years.</p>

<p>"But," says Dr. Hakewel,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "the strangest that I have met
with of this kind, is the history of Eve Fliegen, out of Dutch
translated into English, and printed at London, <i>anno</i> 1611,
who, being born at Meurs, is said to have taken no kind of sustenance
for the space of fourteen years together; that is, from
the year of her age, twenty-two to thirty-six, and from the year
of our Lord 1597 to 1611; and this we have confirmed by the
testimony of the magistrates of the town of Meurs, as also by
the minister who made trial of her in his house thirteen days
together by all the means he could devise, but could detect no
imposture." Over the picture of this maid, set in front of the
Dutch copy, stand these Latin verses:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Meurs&aelig; h&aelig;c quam cernis decies ter, sexque peregit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Annos, bis septem prorsus non viscitur annis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec potat, sic sola sedet, sic pallida vitam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ducit, et exigui se oblectat floribus horti."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Thus rendered in the English copy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"This maid of Meurs thirty and six years spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fourteen of which she took no nourishment;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus pale and wan she sits sad and alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A garden's all she loves to look upon."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Franciscus Citesius,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> physician to the King of France and
to Cardinal Richelieu, devotes a good deal of space and attention
to the case of Joan Balaam, a native of the city of Constance.
She was well grown, but of bad manners. About the
eleventh year of her age she was attacked with a fever, and
among other symptoms vomited for twenty days. Then she
became speechless and so continued for twenty-four days.
Then she talked, but her speech was raving and incoherent.
Finally she lost all power of motion and of sensibility in the
parts below the head and could not swallow. From thenceforth
she could not be persuaded to take food. Six months
afterwards she regained the use of her limbs, but the inability
to swallow remained and she acquired a great loathing for all
kinds of meat and drink. The secretions and excretions appeared
to be arrested. Nevertheless she was very industrious,
employing her time in running errands, sweeping the house,
spinning, and such like. This maid continued thus fasting for
the space of nearly three years, and then by degrees took to
eating and drinking again.</p>

<p>Before coming to more recent cases, there is one other to
which I desire to refer for the reason mainly that in it there
was probably organic disease in addition to fraud and hysteria.
It is cited by Fabricius<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and by Wanley. <i>Anno Dom.</i>, 1595, a
maid of about thirteen years was brought out of the dukedom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of Juliers to Cologne, and there in a broad street at the sign
of the White Horse exposed to the sight of as many as desired
to see her. The parents of this maid affirmed that she had
lived without any kind of food or drink for the space of three
whole years; and this they confirmed by the testimony of
divers persons, such as are worthy of credit. Fabricius observed
her with great care. She was of a sad and melancholy
countenance; her whole body was sufficiently fleshy except
only her belly, which was compressed so as that it seemed to
cleave to her back-bone. Her liver and the rest of her bowels
were perceived to be hard by laying the hand on the belly. As
for excrements, she voided none; and did so far abhor all
kinds of food, that when one, who came to see her privately,
put a little sugar in her mouth she immediately swooned away.
But what was most wonderful was, that this maid walked
up and down, played with other girls, danced, and did all
other things that were done by girls of her age; neither had
she any difficulty of breathing, speaking or crying out. Her
parents declared that she had been in this condition for three
years.</p>

<p>A great many more to the same effect might be adduced,
but the foregoing are sufficient to indicate the fact that belief
in the possibility of such occurrences was quite general, and
that if doubt did exist in regard to their real nature, it was not
so strong as not readily to be overcome by the tricks and devices
of hysterical women.</p>

<p>In the following instances of more modern date the reader
will perceive the view which is taken of them by physicians of
the present day, and will doubtless discover their real nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>About sixty-five years ago, a woman of Sudbury, in Staffordshire,
England, named Ann Moore, declared that she did
not eat, and a number of persons volunteered to watch her, in
order to ascertain whether or not she was speaking the truth.
The watch was continued for three weeks and then the watchers,
as in other instances, reported that Ann Moore was a real
case of abstinence from food of all kinds. The Bible was always
kept open on Ann's bed. Her emaciation was so extreme
that it was said her vertebral column could be felt through the
abdominal walls. This sad condition was asserted to have
been caused by her washing the linen of a person affected with
ulcers. From that time she experienced a dislike for food, and
even nausea at the sight or mention of it.</p>

<p>As soon as the watchers reported in favor of the genuineness
of Ann's pretensions her notoriety increased, and visitors
came from all parts of the country, leaving donations to the
extent of two hundred and fifty pounds in the course of two
years. Doubts, however, again arose, and, bold from the immunity
she had experienced from the first investigation, Ann
in an evil moment, for the continuance of her fraud, consented
to a second watching. This committee was composed of notable
persons, among them being Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart., Rev.
Legh Richmond, Dr. Fox, and his son, and many other gentlemen
of the country. Two of them were always in her room
night and day. At the suggestion of Mr. Francis Fox, the bedstead,
bedding, and the woman in it were placed on a weighing
machine, and thus it was ascertained that she regularly lost
weight daily. At the expiration of the ninth day of this strict
watching, Dr. Fox found her evidently sinking and told her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she would soon die unless she took food. After a little prevarication,
the woman signed a written confession that she was an
impostor, and had "occasionally taken sustenance for the last
six years." She also stated that during the first watch of three
weeks her daughter had contrived, when washing her face, to
feed her every morning, by using towels made very wet with
gravy, milk, or strong arrowroot gruel, and had also conveyed
food from mouth to mouth in kissing her, which it is presumed
she did very often.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In a clinical lecture delivered at St. George's Hospital,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Dr.
John W. Ogle calls attention to the simulation of fasting as a
manifestation of hysteria, and relates the following amusing
case:</p>

<p>"A girl strongly hysterical, aged twenty, in spite of all persuasion
and medical treatment, refused every kind of food, or
if made to eat, soon vomited the contents of the stomach. On
November 6th, 1869, whilst the girl was apparently suffering in
the same manner, the Queen passed the hospital on her way to
open Blackfriars Bridge. She arose in bed so as to look out of
the window, although up to this time declaring that every
movement of her body caused intense pain. On December 29,
the following letter in the girl's handwriting, addressed to another
patient in the same ward, was picked up from the floor:
'My Dear Mrs. Evens,&mdash;I was very sorry you should take the
trouble of cutting me such a nice piece of bread and butter,
yesterday. I would of taken it but all of them saw you send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
it, and then they would have made enough to have talked
about. But I should be very glad if you would cut me a nice
piece of crust and put it in a piece of paper and send it, or else
bring it, so that they do not see it, for they all watch me very
much, and I should like to be your friend and you to be mine.
Mrs. Winslow, (the nurse) is going to chapel. I will make it up
with you when I can go as far. Do not send it if you cannot
spare it. Good bye, and God bless you.' Although she prevaricated
about this letter, she appears to have gradually improved
from this time on, and one day walked out of the hospital
and left it altogether. She subsequently wrote a letter to
the authorities expressing her regret at having gone on as she
did."</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable instances of the kind, is that of
Sarah Jacob, known as the "Welsh Fasting Girl," and whose
history and tragical death excited a great deal of comment in
the medical and lay press in Great Britain a few years ago.
The following account of the case is mainly derived from Dr.
Fowler's<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> interesting work.</p>

<p>Sarah Jacob was born May 12th, 1857. Her parents were
farmers and were uneducated, simple-minded, and ignorant
persons. In her earlier years she had been healthy, was intelligent,
given to religious reading, and was said to have written
poetry of her own composition. She was a very pretty
child and was, according to the testimony of the vicar, the Rev.
Evan Jones, a "good girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>About February 15th, 1867, when she was not quite ten
years of age, she complained of pain in the pit of the stomach,
and one morning on getting up, she told her mother that she
had found her mouth full of bloody froth. The pain continued,
and medical attendance was obtained. Soon afterwards she had
strong convulsions of an epileptiform character and then other
spasms of a clearly hysterical form, during which her body was
bent in the form of a bow as in tetanus, the head and heels only
touching the bed. Then the muscular spasm ceased and she
fell at full length on the bed. For a whole month she continued
in a state of unconsciousness, suffering from frequent
repetitions of severe convulsive attacks, during which time she
took little food. Mr. Davies, the surgeon, said in his evidence,
that she was for a whole month, in a kind of permanent fit, lying
on her back, with rigidity of all the muscles. For some
time her life was despaired of, then her fits ceased to be convulsive
and consisted of short periods of loss of consciousness
with sudden awakings. For the next two or three months (till
August, 1867) she took daily, from six, gradually decreasing to
four, teacupfuls of rice and milk, or oatmeal and milk, which
according to her father's account, was cast up again immediately
and blood and froth with it. During this time the
bowels were only acted on once in six or nine days. "Up to
this time," said her father, "she could move both arms and
one leg, but the other leg was rigid."</p>

<p>By the beginning of October, 1867, her quantity of daily
food had, it was affirmed, dwindled down to nothing but a little
apple about the size of a pill, which she took from a tea-spoon.
At this time she made water about every other day; she looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
very bad in the face, but was not thin. On the tenth day of
October, it was solemnly declared that she ceased to take any
food whatever, and so continued till the day of her death, December
17th, 1869, a period of two years, two months, and one
week.</p>

<p>"Of the veracity of the assertion in respect of <i>the one week</i>,"
says Dr. Fowler, "there is unfortunately plenty of evidence.
To the absurdity of believing in the barest possibility of twenty-six
months absolute abstinence, it is sufficient to reply that
when to our knowledge, she was completely deprived of food,
the girl died! The parents most persistently impressed upon
every private as well as official visitor, both before and during
the last fatal watching, that the girl did not take food; that
she could not swallow; that whenever food was mentioned to
her she became as it were, excited; that when it was offered
to her she would have a fit, or the offer would make her ill.
The sworn testimony of the vicar, the Rev. Wm. Thomas, Sister
Clinch, Ann Jones, and the other nurses, is sufficiently
confirmative on this point. Furthermore, the parents went so
far as to expressly forbid the mere mention of food in the girl's
presence."</p>

<p>Towards the end of October, 1867, the case had attracted
so much attention that the inhabitants in the neighborhood first
began visiting the marvellous little girl.</p>

<p>"In the beginning of November of the same year, the Rev.
Evan Jones, B.D., the vicar of the parish, was sent for by the
parents to visit Sarah Jacob. He was at once&mdash;by the mother&mdash;told
of the girl's wonderful fasting powers; it was admitted
she took water occasionally. He was also informed of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
extraordinary perversion of her natural functions (the suppression
of urine and f&aelig;cal evacuations.) He found her lying on
her back in bed, which was covered with books. There was
nothing then remarkable about her dress. The girl looked
weak and delicate, though not pale, and answered only in
monosyllables. 'The mother said her child was very anxious
about the state of her soul, that it had such an effect upon her
mind that she could not sleep.' I asked her myself if she had
a desire to become a member of the Church of England? She
said, 'Yes!' She continued to express that wish until July,
1869. At this time the reverend gentleman did not believe in
the statements relative to the girl's abstinence. 'Every time,'
he says, 'that I had a conversation with her up to the end of
1868, the parents both persisted that she lived without food,
and continued their statements in January and February, 1869.
I remonstrated with them and dwelt upon the apparent impossibility
of the thing. They still persisted that it was a fact.'</p>

<p>"Even as late as September, 1869, the vicar reiterated his
ministerial remonstrances. When, in the beginning of the
spring of 1869, he observed the fantastical changes the parents
made in the girl's daily attire, he told them about the remarks
made in the papers about this dressing and dwelt upon the impropriety
of it. They replied, 'She had no other pleasure&mdash;they
did not like denying it to her.' During the following summer,
finding that the girl looked more plump in the face and
that her general improvement was more conspicuous, he said,
'Sarah is evidently improving and gaining, and you say she
takes no food; you are certainly imposing on the public.' I
then dwelt on the sinfulness of continuing the fraud on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
public. I said there were on record several cases of alleged
fasting, some of which had been put to the test and had been
discovered to be impositions; that those families would ever
be held in execration by posterity, and such would be the case
with them whenever this imposture was found out. The mother
then assured me no imposition would be discovered in that
house, because there was none."</p>

<p>The father and mother both said that the Lord provided for
her in a most natural way, and that it was a miracle. The
father always talked about the "Doctor Mawr," meaning God
Almighty; that she was supported by that "Big Doctor."</p>

<p>Then soon began the custom of leaving money or other
presents with the child, till at last every one who visited her,
was expected to give something. Open house was kept and
pilgrims came from near and far to see the wonderful girl who
lived without food.</p>

<p>When money was not forthcoming, presents of clothes,
finery, books, or flowers, appear to have been substituted. Advantage
was taken of these presents to bedeck the child in
every variety of smartness. At one time she had a victorine
about her neck and a wreath about her hair, then again, ornaments
and a jacket on, and her hair neatly dressed with ribbons.
At another time she had a silk shawl, a victorine around
her neck, a small crucifix attached to a necklace, and little
ribbons above the wrists. She had drab gloves on and her bed
was nearly covered with books.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the alleged fasting, Sarah Jacob continued
to improve in health.</p>

<p>And now comes an astounding feature of this most remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
case. The vicar became convinced that the instance was
one of real abstinence. A little hysterical girl twelve years of
age, by her perseverance in lying, had actually succeeded in
inducing an educated gentleman to accept the truth of her
statements! The following letter which was published on the
19th of February, 1869, speaks for itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"A STRANGE CASE.</p>

<p>"To the Editor of the <i>Welshman</i>.</p>

<p>"Sir: Allow me to invite the attention of your readers to a
most extraordinary case. Sarah Jacob, a little girl twelve years
of age, and daughter of Mr. Evan Jacob, Lletherneuadd, in this
parish, has not partaken of a single grain of any kind of food
whatever, during the last sixteen months. She did occasionally
swallow a few drops of water during the first few months
of this period; but now she does not even do that. She still
looks pretty well in the face and continues in the possession of
all her mental faculties. She is in this and several other respects,
a wonderful little girl.</p>

<p>"Medical men persist in saying that the thing is quite impossible,
but all the nearest neighbors, who are thoroughly acquainted
with the circumstances of the case, entertain no doubt
whatever of the subject, and I am myself of the same opinion.</p>

<p>"Would it not be worth their while for medical men to
make an investigation into the nature of this strange case? Mr.
Evan Jacob would readily admit into his house any respectable
person who might be anxious to watch it and to see for himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may add, that Lletherneuadd is a farm-house about a
mile from New Inn, in this parish.</p>

<div class="bk2">
<p class="center">"Yours faithfully,<br /></p>
<p class="td2">"<span class="smcap">The Vicar of Llanfihangel-ar-Arth</span>."</p></div></div>

<p>The suggestions of the vicar relative to an investigation,
were soon after afterwards acted upon by certain gentlemen of
the neighborhood. A public meeting was called and a committee
of watchers was appointed to be constantly in attendance
in the room with Sarah Jacob, and to observe to the best
of their ability, whether or not she took any food during the
investigation. It was agreed that the watching was to continue
for a fortnight.</p>

<p>Prior to the beginning of this watching, no precautions
were taken against food being conveyed into the room and concealed
there. The parents actually debarred the watchers
from touching the child's bed. The very first element of success
was therefore denied, and no wonder that the whole affair
was subsequently regarded as an absurdity. The watching
consisted in two different men taking alternate watches from
eight till eight. The watching to see whether the child partook
of food, commenced on March 22d, and ended April 5th, 1869&mdash;a
period of fourteen days.</p>

<p>During the above fortnight, one of the watchers, in turn,
was always close to her bed, and in her sight day and night,
and at the time the bed was being made, which was generally
every other morning, the four persons were always present and
had every article thoroughly examined. The parents were
allowed to go near the bed, as also was the little sister, six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
years old, who had been Sarah's constant companion and bed-fellow.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 7th, 1869, a public meeting was
held at the Eagle Inn, Llandyfeil, to hear the statements of
the parents and of the several persons who had watched the
child during the fourteen days. The parents briefly detailed
the condition and symptoms of their daughter from the commencement
of her illness. At no time during the whole fourteen
days did the pulse ever reach above ninety per minute,
although exceedingly changeable, as it always had been. The
following evidence was received from the watchers, and it is
<i>said</i> that their statements were duly verified on oath before a
magistrate:&mdash;</p>

<p>Watcher No. 1 said: I, Evan Edward Smith, watched Sarah
Jacob for two consecutive nights, (<i>i. e.</i>, nights 22d and 23d of
March) at the request of Mr. H. H. Davies, surgeon. The parents
gave every facility to investigate the matter. I watched
her with all possible care, and found nothing to suspect that
food or drink was given her by foul means. I am quite sure
she had nothing during my watch. I was dismissed on account
of being suspected to doze on the second night.</p>

<p>Watcher No. 2. This watcher watched Sarah Jacob for a
whole fortnight, and found no indications that the child had
anything to eat or drink. He was a college student, Daniel
Harris Davies.</p>

<p>Watcher No. 3. John Jones, a shopkeeper, gave similar
evidence. He was a decided sceptic before he began watching,
but after twelve days was thoroughly convinced of the fact that
nothing in the shape of nourishment was given to the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
child. He watched every movement of all the inmates, and
found nothing that would lead him to suspect that any nourishment
was given to the little girl.</p>

<p>Watcher No. 4. James Harris Davies, a medical student,
spoke in like manner, and was perfectly positive that nothing
had been given to her during the fortnight he had watched
there, with the exception of three drops of water, once, to
moisten her lips with. He was as great a sceptic as any one
before he began watching, but as he saw nothing to confirm his
suspicions, he could conscientiously say that nothing had been
given her during his watch.</p>

<p>Watcher No. 5. Evan Davies, of Powel Castle, who only
watched her for one day, gave similar evidence, but as he was
a neighbour he was dismissed for a stranger.</p>

<p>Watcher No. 6. Herbert Jones, watched only one day, and
spoke in a similar manner, and was dismissed on account of
his credulity.</p>

<p>Watcher No. 7. Thomas Davies, who had been the greatest
sceptic of all, was strongly convinced. He watched Sarah Jacob
twelve days, and was quite positive that nothing could have
been given her during his watch. He watched her with all
possible care, and was very cautious to be in a prominent place,
where Sarah Jacob's mouth was always in sight.</p>

<p>Evidence, however, was given which went to show that the
watching was very imperfectly performed; that occasionally
the watchers left before their time had expired; that intoxicating
liquors were taken by them to the house, and that one of
them was drunk while there. It was also shown that the father
and mother had free access to the bed, while the watchers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
absolutely prohibited from examining it. It is therefore with
entire justification that Dr. Fowler states that the watching
"was the greatest possible farce and mockery."</p>

<p>After the report of the watchers the notoriety of Sarah Jacob
of course became still greater; crowds came to visit her,
and among others the Rev. Frederic Rowland Young went to see
her, and made an unsuccessful effort to cure her by laying on
of hands. When Dr. Fowler visited her, August 30th, 1869, on
getting out at the nearest railway station, he was met by little
boys bearing placards with the words "Fasting Girl," and
"This is the shortest way to Llethernoryadd-ucha," on them.
In his letter to the <i>Times</i>, giving an account of his visit, Dr.
Fowler says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The first impression was most unfavorable, and to a medical
man the appearances were most suspicious. The child was
lying on a bed decorated as a bride, having around her head a
wreath of flowers, from which was suspended a smart ribbon,
the ends of which were joined by a small bunch of flowers, after
the present fashion of ladies' bonnet strings. Before her, at
proper reading distance, was an open Welsh book, supported
by two other books on her body. The blanket covering was
clean, tidy, and perfectly smooth. Across the fire-place, which
was nearly opposite the foot of her bed, was an arrangement of
shelves, well stocked with English and Welsh books, the gifts
of various visitors to the house. The child is thirteen years of
age, and is undoubtedly very pretty. Her face was plump, and
her cheeks and lips of a beautiful rosy color. Her eyes were
bright and sparkling, the pupils were very dilated, in a measure
explicable by the fact of the child's head and face being shaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the window-light by the projecting side of the cupboard
bedstead. There was that restless movement and frequent
looking out at the corners of the eyes so characteristic of
simulative disease. Considering the lengthened inactivity of
the girl, her muscular development was very good, and the
amount of fat layer not inconsiderable. My friend stated
that she looked even better than she did about a twelvemonth
ago. There was a slight perspiration over the surface of the
body. The pulse was perfectly natural, as were also the sounds
of the lungs and heart, so far as I was enabled to make a
stethoscopic examination. Having received permission to do
this, I proceeded to make the necessary derangement of dress,
when the girl went off into what the mother called a fainting fit.
This consisted of nothing but a little and momentary hysterical
crying and sobbing. The color never left the lips or cheeks. The
pulse remained of the same power. Consciousness could have
been but slightly diminished, inasmuch as on my then opening
the eyelids I perceived a distinct upward and other movement
of the eyeballs. Each percussion stroke of my examination,
and even the pressure of the stethoscope, produced an expression
of pain, which elicited a natural sympathy from the mother,
and an assertion that a continuance of such examination would
bring on further fits. On percussing the region of the stomach,
I most distinctly perceived the sound of gurgling, which we
know to be caused by the admixture of air and fluid in motion.
The most positive assertion of the parents was subsequently
made that saving a fortnightly moistening of her lips with
cold water, the child had neither ate nor drank anything for the
last twenty-three months. The whole region of the belly was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
tympanitic, and the muscular walls of this cavity were tense
and drum-like&mdash;a condition not infrequently concomitant of a
well-known class of nervous disorders. The child's intellectual
faculties and special senses were perfectly healthy. Before her
illness she was very much devoted to religious reading. This
devotion has lately considerably increased. She is a member
of the Church of England, and has been confirmed."</p>

<p>Dr. Fowler then adds some other interesting particulars, all
going to show the impossibility of the girl's being the subject
of any exhausting disease, or of even having been continuously
in bed, as her parents asserted, for nearly two years; and then
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The whole case is in fact one of simulative hysteria, in a
young girl having the propensity to deceive very strongly developed.
Therewith may be probably associated the power or
habit of prolonged fasting. Both patient and mother admitted
the occasional occurrence of the choking sensation called
<i>globus hystericus</i>."</p>

<p>This letter excited renewed discussion in the newspapers,
and a second public meeting was called to make arrangements
for a second watching. At this meeting it was decided to bring
down from Guy's Hospital, London, several trained nurses, who
were to conduct the watching; and the following resolutions
were adopted, as expressing the terms under which the inquiry
was to be conducted:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It would be advisable, before taking any steps in the
matter, to obtain a written legal guarantee from the father of
Sarah Jacob sanctioning the necessary proceedings. 2. That
the duty of the nurses shall be to watch Sarah Jacob with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
view to ascertain whether she partakes of any kind of food, and
at the end of a fortnight to report upon the case before the
local committee in Carmarthenshire, and, if required, at Guy's
Hospital. 3. That two nurses shall be constantly awake and
on the watch in the girl's room, night and day. 4. It would be
advisable for the nearest medical practitioner to watch the progress
of the case; and it will be absolutely necessary for him
to <i>be prepared against any serious symptoms of exhaustion, supervening
on the strict enforcement of the watching, and to act according
to his judgment</i>. 5. That the room in which the girl sleeps
shall be bared of all unnecessary furniture, and all possible
places in the room for the concealment of food shall be closed
and kept under the continual scrutiny of the watchers. 6. That
if considered desirable by the local medical practitioner, or by
the nurses, the bedstead on which the girl now lies shall be replaced
by a single iron one. 7. That the bed on which the
parents now sleep, in Sarah Jacob's room, shall be given up
absolutely to the nurses. 8. That the parents be not allowed
to sleep in the same room as the girl; that if they cannot at all
times be prevented from approaching her, they should be previously
searched (their pockets and other recesses of clothing
as well as the interior of their mouths); and that no wetted
towels or other such articles be allowed to be used about the
girl by the parents, or any other person save the nurses; that
the children of the family, and in fact every other person whatever
(except the nurses), have similar restraints put upon them.
9. That the nurses have the sole management of preparing the
room, bed, and patient, prior to the commencement of the
watching. 10. That, as it is asserted the action of the bowels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and bladder is entirely suspended, special attention must be
directed to these organs.</p>

<p>Four experienced women nurses were accordingly deputed
from Guy's Hospital to take the entire charge of Sarah Jacob,
and to watch her for fourteen days. They were instructed not
to prevent her having food if she asked for it, but they were to
see that she got none without their knowledge. On the 9th of
December, 1869, at 4 <span class="smcapl">P.M.</span>, the room was cleared of people and
the watching began.</p>

<p>In the first place it was ascertained that the girl had repeated
evacuations of urine, and once, at least, of f&aelig;ces.</p>

<p>Gradually evidences of mental and physical disturbance began
to appear. The watch was so closely kept that no food or
drink reached the child, and she did not ask for any.</p>

<p>"At 10 <span class="smcapl">P.M.</span>," to quote the language of the journal kept
by the sister nurse, "she was restless and threw her arms about.
She was very cold, and the nurses put warm flannels on her.
This was the last day on which she passed urine."</p>

<p>Thursday, December 16, 3 <span class="smcapl">A.M.</span>&mdash;She was rolling from one
side of the bed to the other. At half-past three she wished
the bed made, and they made it. She was looking very pale
and anxious. Her eyes were sunk and her nose pinched, and
the cheek bones were prominent. Her arms and hands were
cold, her feet and legs were the same. Ann Jones, one of the
nurses, says in her memoranda, "She was very restless and
appeared to me to be sinking. Her lips were very dry, and
her mouth seemed parched." The peculiar smell (the starvation
smell) about the bed was so strong as to make the sister
nurse quite ill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>At 11 <span class="smcapl">A.M.</span>, the vicar saw her and told the parents that the
child was gradually failing, and suggested to them the propriety
of sending the nurses away and giving her a chance
to obtain food, but they refused, saying that there was nothing
to do but what the nurses were doing, and that they had seen
her quite as weak before. The parents were urged by others
to give up the fight by sending the nurses away, but they refused
on the ground that want of food had nothing to do with
the symptoms, and that she would not eat whether the nurses
were there or not.</p>

<p>Ann Jones subsequently testified before the coroner: "Before
one and two o'clock on Thursday afternoon (Dec. 16), she
kept talking to herself. I could not understand whether she
was speaking Welsh or English. Up to that time I could understand
her. She pointed her fingers at some books; I gave
her one, but she took no notice of it; she was not able to read
it. <i>Both parents were then told the girl was dying.</i>"</p>

<p>Repeatedly they were begged to withdraw the nurses, and
again and again they refused, saying there was no occasion&mdash;that
she had often been in that way, that it was not from want
of food, etc. The girl became weaker and weaker; low, muttering
delirium ensued, and on the 17th of December, 1869, at
about half-past three o'clock, <span class="smcapl">P.M.</span>, the "Welsh Fasting Girl"
died, actually starved to death, in the middle of the nineteenth
century and in one of the most Christian and civilized countries
of the world!</p>

<p>But this was not the end. Public opinion was much excited
both against those who had sanctioned and conducted
what appeared to have been a senseless and cruel experiment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and against the father and mother who had wilfully and persistently
refused to allow food to be given to the dying child.
A coroner's inquest was held, and the coroner appears to have
made a very satisfactory charge to the jury after the rendition
of the testimony. He said there could be no doubt of the child
having died of starvation, and that the responsibility rested
with the father, who had knowingly and designedly failed to
cause his child to take food. The mother was not responsible
unless it could be shown that she had been given food for the
child by the father, and had withheld it from her. It was marvellous,
he said, how the father could have made out such a
story&mdash;such a hideous mass of nonsense, as he had under oath
attempted to impose on the jury.</p>

<p>The jury deliberated for a quarter of an hour, and then returned
a verdict of "Died from starvation, caused by negligence
to induce the child to take food on the part of the
father;" which constituted manslaughter.</p>

<p>Evan Jacob was therefore arrested. But the Secretary of
State for the Home Department took the matter up and determined
that the proceedings should go farther than the local
authorities intended. At first it was contemplated to indict
the members of the General Committee for conspiracy, but it
was finally concluded to include only the medical gentlemen who
had accepted the responsibility of superintending the watching,
as well as both parents of the deceased child.</p>

<p>The initial proceeding took place before a full bench of
magistrates, and continued eight days. The Crown and the accused
had eminent counsel, and many witnesses were examined.
At the conclusion of the inquiry the presiding magistrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
announced that it had been determined by the court that no
case had been made out against the physicians, who had not
been shown to have undertaken any other duty than that of
advising the nurses, and that it did not appear that their advice
had been asked. As to the father and mother the court
had decided to send them both for trial for manslaughter, at
the next assizes. In due time they were arraigned, they
pleaded not guilty, but after being defended by able counsel,
the jury, after an absence of about half an hour, returned with
a verdict of guilty against both the prisoners, but with a recommendation
of the mother to the merciful consideration of
the court, on the ground that she was under the control of her
husband. The man protested his innocence, and the woman
"buried her face in her shawl and wept bitterly."</p>

<p>His Lordship, in passing sentence, said: "Prisoners at
the bar, you have been found guilty of a most aggravated
offence. I entirely concur with the verdict which the jury have
given, and I shall act upon the recommendation which they
have presented in favor of the female prisoner, the mother,
though, I must say, that I cannot but feel that it is a greater
crime in the mother than the father, since it is more contrary
to the common nature of mothers, to neglect their children in
the manner in which you have treated this unfortunate child.
It is contrary to the nature, even, of a father. But I shall act
upon the recommendation of the jury, upon the ground they
have put forward, that you have been subject to the control of
your husband more than has appeared from the evidence of
the case. But the offence is, as I have said, a serious one, on
this ground; that there can be no doubt that both of you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
persisted in this fraudulent deception, upon your neighbors,
and upon the public, and that in order to carry out that fraudulent
deception and to preserve yourselves from detection you
were willing to risk the life of that child. The life of that
child has been lost in that wicked experiment which you tried.
Therefore, the sentence that I shall inflict on you, Evan Jacob,
is, that you be imprisoned and kept at hard labor for twelve
calendar months; and that upon you, Hannah Jacob, will be
more lenient in consideration of the recommendation of the
jury, and it is, that you be imprisoned and kept to hard labor
for the period of six calendar months."</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the most remarkable and interesting
histories of human folly, credulity, and criminality which the
present day has produced. Comment upon its teaching is
scarcely necessary; but the thoughtful reader will not fail to
perceive how important a bearing it has upon the whole subject
of belief without full and free inquiry, and that how all
the facts which science has gathered during ages of painful
labor, go for naught, even with educated persons, when
brought face to face with the false assertions of a hysterical
girl, and of two ignorant and deceitful peasants. If there is
any one thing we know, it is that there can be no force without
the metamorphosis of matter of some kind. Here was a girl
maintaining her weight&mdash;actually growing&mdash;her animal heat
kept at its due standard, her mind active, her heart beating,
her lungs respiring, her skin exhaling, her limbs moving whenever
she wished them to move, and all, as very many persons
supposed, without the ingestion of the material by which alone
such things could be. And yet such is the tendency of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
average human mind to be deceived, that it would be perfectly
possible to re-enact in the city of New York the whole tragedy
of Sarah Jacob, should ever a hysterical girl take it into
head to do so; and there would not be wanting, even from
among those who might read this history, individuals who would
credit any monstrous declarations she might make. Even
now in a little town in Belgium, an ecstatic girl is going
through the same performance with extraordinary additions,
and books are written by learned physicians and theologians,
with the object of establishing the truth of her pretensions.
To this most remarkable instance, and one other of similar
though perhaps even more remarkable characteristic, the attention
of the reader will presently be invited. But in view of
these things one is almost tempted to say with Cardinal Carafa,
"<i>Quandoquidem populus decipi vult, decipiatur</i>."</p>

<h3>ABSTINENCE FROM FOOD WITH STIGMATIZATION.</h3>

<p>One hundred and fifty-three persons have at one time or
another, according to Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> received the
stigmata; that is, been marked in a miraculous manner with
the wounds received by Christ at the crucifixion. Of these,
eight, are according to the same authority now living, and
two assert that they do not eat. I propose to consider
at some length the main points in the histories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of these two, Palma d'Oria and Louise Lateau, and in so
doing I shall avail myself of the works of those, who are firm
believers in the miraculous interposition of God to produce the
effects, of which they are said to be the subjects. These cases
are very little known in this country. Instances of the kind
are extremely rare among practical common sense nations, like
those inhabiting the British Isles, and their descendants in
America. Of the whole one hundred and fifty-three cases recorded
by Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre, but one&mdash;Jane Gray&mdash;was
British, and hers is the most doubtful case in the list, for the
fact rests only on the testimony of one Thomas Bourchier, an
English minor brother, who asserts that she had the stigmata
in the feet. Of the remainder, the very large majority are of
Italy, and as Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre says:</p>

<p>"Quel pays fut jamais si fertile en miracles?"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>To the account of a visit made to Oria for the purpose of
studying the phenomena exhibited by Palma, made by Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre,
I am indebted for the following details:</p>

<p>Palma, at the time of the visit in 1871, was sixty-six years
old, hump-backed, thin, small, and with light, expressive eyes.
For several years she had not left the house, and was, on account
of her sufferings, scarcely able to walk. Occasionally,
when she felt particularly well, she took a few steps about the
room supported by a cane. In her youth she had been very
strong and active.</p>

<p>At the first interview, after some conversation in the course
of which Palma declared that she had often seen Louise Lateau
while in ecstasy, the doctor directed the conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
towards the subject of hallucination. While thus engaged and
seated close to Palma, he felt her strike him gently on the
arm, and at the same time saw the abb&eacute;, who had come with
him, fall on his knees. He turned toward Palma; her eyes
were closed, her hands clasped, her mouth wide open, and on
her tongue he saw the host&mdash;the body of Christ. Immediately,
he fell on his knees also, and worshipped it. Palma protruded
her tongue still farther, as if she wanted to give him every opportunity
of seeing that the host was really there; then she ate
it, closed her mouth and remained perfectly quiet on the sofa
upon which she was reclining. It was then almost four o'clock
in the afternoon, the day was fading, the room was badly lit
by a little window, high from the floor. The miraculous host
appeared to him to be as white as wax, and somewhat thick.
On account of the little light, and the short time that this extraordinary
communion lasted, he was unable to determine
whether or not it was marked according to the custom of the
church.</p>

<p>In regard to this wonderful event&mdash;that is, if it be not a fact
viewed unequally&mdash;it is further to be said that Palma disclosed
to Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre, that two or three times, the
holy element, which be it remembered is believed by the great
majority of Christians to be the real body of Christ, was brought
to her by the devil, and that then she refused it. Sometimes
he had the figure of an angel, but she knew him by the sign of
reprobation which he wore on his forehead&mdash;a little horn.
Moreover she saw that the wicked creature hesitated, and was
a little embarrassed. She intoned the <i>Gloria Patri</i>, and made
the sign of the cross, and he instantly took flight and disappeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
In order to ascertain what it all meant, her confessor
forbade her to receive the miraculous communion for eight
days. Hardly had that period expired when Jesus Christ himself
brought her the communion. Before giving it to her he
made her recite the <i>Gloria Patri</i> three times. Then he said to
her, "Have I fled as the demon did? No. Therefore reassure
yourself. It is really I."</p>

<p>These miraculous circumstances had been going on for
about two years when Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre made his visit to
Palma. Sometimes it was brought to her by Christ, as in the
instance specified, or by some saint, as St. Peter, St. Vincent
de Paul, St. Francis d'Assisi, in the company of her guardian
angel, and other saints and angels. At other times it was brought
by priests and confessors of the olden time, long since dead.</p>

<p>An Italian bishop stated, that at the moment of the miraculous
sacrament on one occasion, he had seen the host flying
through the air before entering Palma's mouth, but the doctor
questioned her attendant on this point, and she declared that
she had not seen that, and she assured him that the host was
never seen by any one till it rested on Palma's tongue. The
doctor inclines to the belief that the attendant was right, but
he states that nevertheless a French apostolic missionary had
asserted that he had seen the same thing.</p>

<p>Well, if the consecrated bread be really the body of Christ
that was given for the salvation of the world, what horrible
blasphemy to state such things of it, what vileness to believe
them, what a barefaced imputation on the reason of man to
spread these shocking details before him and ask him to accept
them as true of the God he worships!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>After witnessing the communion, Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre
was requested to withdraw into the adjoining room, while
Palma got ready for her other performances. In a few minutes
he was informed that all was in order. One of the women
went in first and returning immediately, the others were invited
to enter. The stigmatization had already begun on the forehead.
He saw a stream of blood flowing from the left frontal
eminence along the side of the nose. A handkerchief was
given to Palma; she held it to her nose for a moment and the
h&aelig;morrhage soon stopped. He examined the blood and found
that it did not differ in appearance, color or temperature from
ordinary blood. He then examined the handkerchief, and besides
numerous rotund spots he perceived other figures resembling
hearts, with stains of blood proceeding from them, indicating
the flames of love. All this appeared to him to be very
extraordinary, for though he had often seen people bleed from
the nose, he had never seen them bleed like that.</p>

<p>After this incident Palma continued the performances&mdash;<i>actions
de grace</i> he calls them&mdash;her hands clasped and her eyes
closed. In the lower limbs, especially the left, there was a
tremor like a nervous trembling which was soon quieted. After
a few minutes she rubbed her hands together, made the
sign of the cross and returned naturally to the conversation.
He then examined her forehead and endeavored to ascertain
where the blood had come from. The skin was intact without
the least opening. She showed him above the right frontal eminence
a hole in the cranium, from which at a former period,
five little pieces of bone had been discharged. The opening
was entirely covered over by the scalp, and he was surprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to find that there was no cicatrix. It was round, the end of
his index finger entered it readily, and it was just such an
opening as would have been produced by the crown of a trephine.
At the time it was made, the skin opened to allow of
the exit of the pieces of bone; then it closed without leaving
the trace of a scar. It was the same with the stigmata.
They closed at once without there being any marks to indicate
the place whence the blood had flowed. This hole in the skull
had been caused by some particular circumstances that no one
was willing to reveal to him, but which he says are reported in
the journal of the directors of this woman, and which will
soon be published. Most medical men will come to the conclusion
that it was due to caries and necrosis of the bone, of
syphilitic origin.</p>

<p>During another visit Palma told Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre
that she had eaten nothing for seven years, but that she was
obliged to drink frequently on account of the great internal
heat, which like a fire consumed her. She then drank in his
presence two carafes of water at one time, and the doctor
states that "this water became so hot in her stomach that it
was vomited boiling. She also had often ejected from her
mouth oil, and another fluid of a balsamic character, in which,
on standing for some time, bodies resembling the consecrated
host were formed."</p>

<p>The doctor then relates the following details, which I give
in his own words, in further illustration of the character of his
mental organization and of the pretensions put forth by the
woman, whose word seems to have been sufficient to convince
him of anything at all, no matter how preposterous. Four years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
previously he had been so unfortunate as to lose by death his
eldest child:</p>

<p>"A year after his death, I had met a woman of great
renown for piety, and who was even regarded as a receiver of
celestial communications. I had commended my poor Joseph
to her. Some time after she assured me that my son was
saved, and that he was in paradise. She declared that in a vision
she had seen him near our Lord; he was happy. Various circumstances,
which it is useless to mention here, had caused me
to believe in the truth of this asserted revelation. Being in
Oria, I wished to have as much certainty as possible in regard
to the matter, and as I knew that Palma was in spiritual communication
with many pious souls scattered over the earth, I
said to her in the course of our conversation, 'tell me, Palma,
do you know M. &mdash;&mdash; de X&mdash;&mdash;,' giving her the baptismal
name of the woman in question. 'No sir,' she answered. I
then related to her my history in detail, taking care not to ask
her opinion in advance, although I felt sure that she would
explain the thing to me. She listened with the utmost attention
to the superioress who translated my words, and when
Mother Becaud came to say that the woman had had a vision of
my son, and that he was in paradise, Palma stretched out her
arm in a solemn manner as a sign of negative, and said to me,
'He is saved, but he is still in purgatory.'</p>

<p>"'Is it possible? Palma,' I cried, profoundly moved: 'Since you
tell me this, you are in conscience bound to get him out of that
place of expiation as soon as possible, and I commend him immediately
to your prayers.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' she said, 'I will pray for him, and when I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sure of his deliverance, I will send you word by Father de
Pace.'</p>

<p>"The following morning at my visit I again commended my
poor child to Palma, and on the following Friday evening on
taking leave of her, I asked if she had prayed that morning for
my son, 'No sir,' she answered. 'I will only do so on the day of
All Saints.' 'Then,' said I to Palma, 'will you allow madame
the superioress to take the answer?' 'Very willingly,' said the
seeress. On the 7th of November, I received at Nice the
following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"'I have fulfilled the promise which I made to you in
accordance with your wish to go to Palma on All Saints Day,
in order to ascertain whether or not your wishes in regard to
your son had been granted. That good soul assured me twice
that he had gone to heaven that very morning, God be praised
a thousand times!</p>

<p>"'Thus sir, I have done what I could for your consolation.</p>

<div class="bk2"><p class="center">"'I have the honor to be, etc.</p>
<p class="td2">"'Sister Marie Becaud.'</p></div></div>

<p>"This letter was post marked at Oria, November 2d."</p>

<p>I should not venture to insult the intelligence of the reader
with these idiotic details but for the reasons stated, and additionally,
that they carry conviction with them to thousands of
minds, honest doubtless, but which are accustomed to grovel
in superstition, and falsehood, which they are unable to test by
right standards.</p>

<p>A phase in Palma's spiritual pathology has been alluded to
cursorily, but has not yet been considered with the fulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
proper in connection with stigmatization, and that is the occurrence
of h&aelig;morrhagic spots on various parts of her body, and
which she so managed as to convey the idea that they were
symbolical of various holy things. On the back of her hand
she convinced Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre that she bled in the
shape of the cross, and he gives a wood-cut representing a
cross on the dorsum of the hand, a little above the space between
the first and second fingers. This is surrounded by
other rectilinear figures. On her breast and back, other figures
were obtained by placing handkerchiefs on the parts. The
doctor thus procured several mementoes of his visit, in the
shape of pieces of linen stained with spots of blood somewhat
resembling hearts, with flames coming out of them, suns,
roses, crosses, etc. He gives several plates in his book representing
these figures, of the reality of the miraculous formation
of which he has not the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon has also been mentioned incidentally,
and that is the intense heat which Palma declared she felt, and
which the doctor refers to as the "divine fire." He had
brought with him from Paris, a thermometer to use in determining
the extraordinary temperature of this fire. He
examined her with this instrument while she felt this divine
fire, but failed to find any abnormal increase; her pulse at the
time was 72. "I made this experiment," he says, "to satisfy
my scientific conscience, [God save the mark!] but I ought to
say that I was ashamed of myself for presuming to measure
this divine fire by such an instrument." He is right, science is
not for him, or those like him.</p>

<p>On one occasion while Palma was in ecstasy, Antonietta,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
who was near her, laid bare her chest a little, and cried with
enthusiasm, "she is burning!" Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre approached
and smelt something like the burning of linen.
The dress was opened and her chemise was found to be burnt
on the left side just over the collar bone, and immediately below
this, scorched in the shape of "a magnificent emblem representing
a monstrance. The fire was invisible, but its traces
were very evident."</p>

<p>In a note he states that it was affirmed that Palma's temperature
on similar occasions had reached 100&deg; centigrade, (212&deg;
Fahrenheit) a fact which he does not doubt, although his thermometer
did not show it. "That her chemise," he says, "burnt
by invisible fire, which escaped the thermometer, was more extraordinary
than if the instrument had indicated a temperature
of 100&deg;."</p>

<p>I shall not stop now to comment further on the circumstances
detailed by Dr. Imbert-Gourbeyre, and of which I have
cited but a small part. I will only say at present that science
and common sense would conclude in regard to Palma d'Oria,</p>

<p>1st. That she had probably at a former period contracted
syphilis.</p>

<p>2d. That she was strongly hysterical.</p>

<p>3d. That she was the subject of purpura h&aelig;morrhagica.</p>

<p>4th. That she was a most unmitigated humbug and liar.</p>

<p>And now we come to the consideration of a case of stigmatization
which has greatly stirred both the theological and the
scientific world of Europe&mdash;that of Louise Lateau&mdash;and here
again I shall draw largely, though by no means exclusively, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the works of the believers in the miraculous production of the
phenomena manifested.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Louise Lateau was born at Bois-d'Haine, a small village in
Belgium, on the 30th of January, 1850. She was reared in the
utmost poverty, was chlorotic, and did not menstruate till she was
eighteen years old. She loved solitude and silence, and when
not engaged in work&mdash;and she does not appear to have labored
much&mdash;she spent her time in meditation and prayer. She was
subject to paroxysms of ecstasy, during which, as many other
ecstasies, she spoke very edifying things, of charity, poverty, and
the priesthood. She saw St. Ursula, St. Roch, St. Theresa,
and the Holy Virgin. Persons who saw her in these states declared
that, while lying on the bed, her whole body was raised
up more than a foot high, the heels alone being in contact with
the bed.</p>

<p>The stigmatization ensued very soon after these seizures.
On a Friday she bled from the left side of her chest. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
following Friday this flow was renewed, and in addition, blood
escaped from the dorsal surfaces of both feet; and on the third
Friday, not only did she bleed from the side and feet, but also
from the dorsal and palmar surface of both hands. Every succeeding
Friday the blood flowed from these places, and finally
other points of exit were established on the forehead and between
the shoulders.</p>

<p>At first these bleedings only took place at night, but after
two or three months they occurred in the daytime, and were accompanied
by paroxysms of ecstasy, during which she was insensible
to all external impressions, and acted the passion of
Jesus and the crucifixion.</p>

<p>M. Warlomont, being commissioned by the Royal Academy
of Medicine of Belgium to examine Louise Lateau, went to her
house, accompanied by several friends, and made a careful examination
of her person. At that time, Friday morning at six
o'clock, the blood was flowing freely from all the stigmata. In
a few moments the sacrament would be brought to her, and
then the second act of the drama would begin. The scene that
followed can be best described in M. Warlomont's own words:</p>

<p>"It is a quarter-past six. 'Here comes the communion,'
said M. Niels [a priest], 'kneel down.' Louise fell on her knees
on the floor, closed her eyes and crossed her hands, on which
the communion-cloth was extended. A priest, followed by several
acolytes, entered; the penitent put out her tongue, received
the holy wafer, and then remained immovable in the attitude
of prayer.</p>

<p>"We observed her with more care than seemed to have been
hitherto given to her at similar periods. Some thought that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
she was simply in a state of meditation, from which she would
emerge in the course of half an hour or so. But it was a mistake.
Having taken the communion, the penitent went into a
special state. Her immobility was that of a statue, her eyes
were closed; on raising the eyelids the pupils were seen to be
largely dilated, immovable, and apparently insensible to light.
Strong pressure made upon the parts in the vicinity of the stigmata
caused no sensation of pain, although a few moments before
they were exquisitely tender. Pricking the skin gave no
evidence of the slightest sensibility. A limb, on being raised,
offered no resistance, and sank slowly back to its former position.
An&aelig;sthesia was complete, unless the cornea remained
still impressionable. The pulse had fallen from 120 to 100
pulsations. At a given moment I raised one of the eyelids, and
M. Verriest quickly touched the cornea. Louise at once seemed
to recover herself from a sound sleep, arose and walked to a
chair, upon which she seated herself. 'This time,' I said, 'we
have wakened her.' 'No,' said M. Niels, looking at his watch,
'it was time for her to awake.'"</p>

<p>She remained conscious; the blood still continued to flow;
the an&aelig;sthesia had ceased, her pulse rose to 120, and at the
end of half an hour she was herself. "Our first visit ended
here. At half-past eleven we made another. The poor child
had resumed her attitude of extreme suffering, against which
she contended with all the energy that remained to her. The
wounds in the hands still continued to bleed. M. Verriest auscultated
with care the lungs, heart, and great vessels, and found
the <i>bruit de souffle</i>, which he had detected in the morning at the
apex of the heart and over the carotids. The handle of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
spoon pressed against the velum, the base of the tongue, and
the pharynx, provoked no effort at vomiting. The glasses of
our spectacles, as they came in contact with the air expired,
were covered with vapor. As the patient appeared to suffer
from our presence, we went away.</p>

<p>"We made our third visit at two o'clock. There were still
fifteen minutes before the beginning of the ecstatic crisis, which
always took place punctually at a quarter past two and ended
at about half past four. The pupils at this time were slightly
contracted, the eyelids were almost entirely closed; the eyes,
looking at nothing, were veiled from our view. We tried in
vain to attract her attention; her mind was otherwise engaged,
and her pains were evidently becoming more intense. At exactly
a quarter past two her eyes became fixed in a direction
above and to the right. The ecstasy had begun.</p>

<p>"The time had now come to introduce those who were
prompted by curiosity. This could now be done without inconvenience,
for the ecstatic, for the ensuing two hours, would
be lost to the appreciation of what might be passing around
her. The room crowded, could hold about ten persons, but
enough were allowed to enter to make the total twenty-five.
These placed themselves in two ranks, of which the front one
kneeling, allowed the rear ones to see all that was going on.
All this was done under the direction of M. le Cur&eacute;, who took
every pains to give us a good view of what was going to
happen.</p>

<p>"Louise was seated on the edge of her chair; her body,
inclined forward, seemed to wish to follow the direction of her
eyes, which did not look, but were fixed on vacancy. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
eyes were opened to their fullest extent, of a dull, lustreless
appearance, turned above and to the right, and of an absolute
immobility. A few workings of the lids were now observed
and became more frequent if the eyelids were touched. The
pupils, largely dilated, showed very little sensibility to light,
and all that remained of vision was shown by slight winking
when the hand was suddenly brought close to the eyes. The
whole face lacked expression. At certain moments, either
spontaneously or as a consequence of divers provocations, a
light smile, to which the muscles of the face generally did not
contribute, wandered over her lips. Then the face resumed
its primitive expression, and thus she remained for the half-hour
which constituted the 'first station.'</p>

<p>"The 'second station' was that of genuflection. It had
failed at one time, but had again appeared. The young girl
fell on her knees, clasped her hands, and remained for about a
quarter of an hour in the attitude of contemplation. Then she
arose and again resumed her sitting posture.</p>

<p>"The 'third station' began at three o'clock. Louise inclined
herself a little forward, raised her body slowly, and
then extended herself at full length, face downward, on the
floor. There was neither rigidity nor extreme precipitation;
nothing in fact, calculated to produce injuries. The knees
first supported her body, then it rested on these and the
elbows, and finally her face was brought in actual close contact
with the tiled floor. At first the head rested on the left arm,
but very soon the patient made a quick and sudden movement,
and the arms were extended from the body in the form of a
cross. At the same time the feet were brought together so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that the dorsum of the right was in contact with the sole of the
left foot. This position did not vary for an hour and a half.
When the end of the crisis approached, the arms were brought
close to the sides of the body, then suddenly the poor girl rose
to her knees, her face turns to the wall, her cheeks become
colored, her eyes have regained their expression, her countenance
expands, and the ecstasy is at an end."</p>

<p>Further particulars are given, and an apparatus was constructed
and applied to Louise's hand and arm so as to prevent
any external excitation of the h&aelig;morrhage. It was apparently
shown that there was no such interference, for the
blood began to flow at the usual time on Friday.</p>

<p>In addition to the stigmata and the paroxysms of ecstasy,
Louise declared that she did not sleep, had eaten or drank
nothing for four years, had had no f&aelig;cal evacuation for three
years and a half, and that the urine was entirely suppressed.</p>

<p>M. Warlomont examined the blood and products of respiration
chemically, and satisfied himself of their normal character,
except that the former contained an excessive amount of
white corpuscles.</p>

<p>When being closely interrogated, Louise admitted that,
though she did not sleep, she had short periods of forgetfulness
at night. On M. Warlomont suddenly opening a cupboard in
her room, he found it to contain fruit and bread, and her chamber
communicated directly with a yard at the back of the
house. It was therefore perfectly possible for her to have
slept, eaten, defecated, and urinated, without any one knowing
that she did so.</p>

<p>The conclusions arrived at by M. Warlomont were, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
stigmatizations and ecstasies of Louise Lateau were real and to
be explained upon well-known physiological and pathological
principles, that she "worked, and dispensed heat, that she lost
every Friday a certain quantity of blood by the stigmata, that
the air she expired contained the vapor of water and carbonic
acid, that her weight had not materially altered since she had
come under observation. She consumes carbon and it is not
from her own body that she gets it. Where does she get it
from? Physiology answers, 'She eats.'"</p>

<p>Relative to the assumed abstinence in the cases of Palma
d'Oria, Louise Lateau and other subjects of ecstasy and stigmata,
it is not necessary, in view of the remarks already made
on this subject in a previous chapter, to devote further consideration
to it here. The conclusion arrived at by M. Warlomont
is the only one which science can tolerate. Should Louise
Lateau or Palma d'Oria ever be subjected to as close watching
as was the poor little Welsh Fasting Girl, Sarah Jacob, it
will certainly terminate as badly for them as for her, unless
they yield to the demands of nature and take the food which
the organism requires.</p>

<h3>THE BROOKLYN CASE.</h3>

<p>For several years past there have been rumors more or less
definite in character that a young lady in Brooklyn was not
only living without food, but was possessed of some mysterious
faculty by which she could foretell events, read communications
without the aid of the eyes, and accurately describe occurrences
in distant places, through clairvoyance or whatever other
name may be applied to the influence.</p>

<p>Finally, in the <i>New York Herald</i> of October 20th, 1878,
appeared an account, headed "Life without Food. An Invalid
Lady who for fourteen years has lived without nourishment."
As this account is apparently authentic, and as the statements
made have never been contradicted, I do not hesitate to quote
from it. Some of the letters which have appeared in response
to a proposition I offered, and to which fuller reference will
presently be made, have accused me of dragging the young lady
before the public. It will be seen, however, that her friends
and physicians are responsible for all the publicity given to the
case.</p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration for the present the alleged
marvellous endowments of this young lady, as regards seeing
without her eyes, second sight, etc., I quote from the <i>Herald</i>
the essential points relative to her clinical history and abstinence
from food:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"In a modest, secluded house at the corner of Myrtle
Avenue and Downing Street, Brooklyn, lives an invalid lady
afflicted with paralysis, with a history so remarkable and extraordinary
that, notwithstanding it is vouched for by physicians
of standing, it is almost incredible. It is claimed that for a
period of nearly fourteen years she has lived absolutely without
food or nourishment of any kind. The case has been kept by
the family of the patient a well guarded secret, it having led
them to a strict seclusion as the only means of protection
against the visits of the curious and incredulous.</p>

<p>"The name of the remarkable person is Miss Mollie Fancher.
To the half dozen medical gentlemen who have seen and attended
her, her case is inexplicable. To learn the history of
the strange case a <i>Herald</i> reporter yesterday called on several
persons familiar with the facts. The first person seen was Dr.
Ormiston, of No. 74 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, who attended
her. He said:&mdash;'It seems incredible, but from everything I
can learn Mollie Fancher never eats. The elder Miss Fancher,
her aunt, who takes care of her, is a lady of the highest intelligence.
She was at one time quite wealthy, and she has at
present a comfortable income. I have every reason to believe
that her statements are in every detail reliable. During a
dozen visits to the sick chamber I have never detected evidence
of the patient having eaten a morsel.'"</p>

<p>After interviewing a lady intimate with the family, the reporter
sought out Dr. Speir, the attending physician of the
patient, and thus details his experience with that gentleman:</p>

<p>"Dr. Speir was found in his comfortable little office, and the
errand of the writer made known:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Is it true, Doctor, that a patient of yours has lived for fourteen
years without taking food?'</p>

<p>"'If you refer to Miss Fancher, yes. She became my patient
in 1864. Her case is a most remarkable one.'</p>

<p>"'But has she eaten nothing during all these years?'</p>

<p>"'I can safely say she has not.'</p>

<p>"'Are the family also willing to vouch for the truth of this
extraordinary statement?'</p>

<p>"'You will find them very reticent to newspaper men and to
strangers generally. I do not believe any food&mdash;that is, solids&mdash;ever
passed the woman's lips since her attack of paralysis,
consequent upon her mishap. As for an occasional teaspoonful
of water or milk, I sometimes force her to take it by using
an instrument to pry open her mouth, but that is painful to
her. As early as 1865 I endeavored to sustain life in this way,
for I feared that, in obedience to the universal law of nature,
she would die of gradual inanition or exhaustion, which I
thought would sooner or later ensue; but I was mistaken.
The case knocks the bottom out of all existing medical theories,
and is, in a word, miraculous.'</p>

<p>"'Did you ever,' asked the reporter, 'make an experiment
to satisfy your professional accuracy in regard to her abstinence?'</p>

<p>"'Several times I have given her emetics on purpose to discover
the truth; but the result always confirmed the statement
that she had taken no food. It sounds strangely, but it is so.
I have taken every precaution against deception, sometimes
going into the house at eleven or twelve o'clock at night, without
being announced, but have always found her the same, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lying in the same position occupied by her for the entire period
of her invalidity. The springs of her bedstead are actually
worn out with the constant pressure. My brethren in the
medical profession at first were inclined to laugh at me, and
call me a fool and spiritualist when I told them of the long
abstinence and keen mental powers of my interesting patient.
But such as have been admitted to see her are convinced.
These are Dr. Ormiston, Dr. Elliott and Dr. Hutchison, some
of the best talent in the city, who have seen and believed.'"</p>

<p>And then the following account is given of the accident from
which the young lady suffered, and to which the remarkable
phenomena she is said to exhibit are ascribed:</p>

<p>"The story of Miss Fancher's accident and its melancholy
consequences is quite affecting. It is collected from the various
statements given by half a dozen friends of the family to
the <i>Herald</i> reporter. Interwoven with it is a thread of romance,
a tale of early love and courtship, of a life embittered
by a cruel accident, of patient waiting, and a final release of
the suitor from his engagement to marry another.</p>

<p>"Mary's parents live in a sumptuous dwelling on Washington
Avenue, Brooklyn, and were reported to be wealthy. Their
favorite daughter Mollie, as she was called, was sent to Prof.
West's High School in Brooklyn at an early age, and here
developed many brilliant qualities of mind and heart, which
augured well for her future. At seventeen she was pretty,
petite and well cultivated. As a member of the Washington
Avenue Baptist Sunday School, she met and learned to love a
classmate, named John Taylor. An engagement followed the
intimacy of the Sunday School class, and the young people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
looked forward with buoyant spirits to the bright life so soon
to dawn upon them.</p>

<p>"But fate decreed differently. While getting off a Fulton
Street car one day in 1864, on her return from school, the
young lady slipped and fell backward. Her skirt caught on
the step unseen by the conductor, who started the car on its
way again. The poor girl was dragged some ten or fifteen
yards before her cries were heard and the brake applied. When
picked up she was insensible and was carried, suffering intense
agony from an injured spine, to her home near by. Forty-eight
hours afterward she was seized with a violent spasm which
lasted for over two days. Then came a trance, when the sufferer
grew cold and rigid, with no evidence of life beyond a
warm spot under the left breast, where feeble pulsations of her
heart were detected by Dr. Speir. Only this gentleman believed
she was alive, and it was due to his constant assertion of
the girl's ultimate recovery that Miss Fancher was not buried.
Despite the best medical help and the application of restoratives,
no change was brought about in the patient's condition
until the tenth week, when the strange suspension of life ceased
and breath was once more inhaled and breathed forth from her
lungs.</p>

<p>"To their dismay the doctors then found that Mollie had lost
her sight and the power of deglutition, the latter affliction rendering
it impossible for her to swallow food or even articulate
by the use of tongue or lip. Previous to her trance a moderate
quantity of food had been given her each day; but since then
she has not taken a mouthful of life-sustaining food. Spasms
and trances alternated with alarming frequency since Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Fancher was first attacked. First her limbs only became rigid
and disturbed at the caprice of her strange malady; but as
time passed her whole frame writhed as if in great pain, requiring
to be held by main force in order to remain in the bed.
She could swallow nothing, and lay utterly helpless until
moved."</p>

<p>In the <i>Sun</i>, of November 24th, 1878, a fuller account of this
young lady was given, mainly however, in regard to her "clairvoyant,"
or "second-sight" power. Relative to her abstinence
from food, I quote the following conversation between the reporter
and Dr. Speir.</p>

<p>"'Is it true that she has not partaken of food in all these
thirteen years?'</p>

<p>"'No: I cannot say that she has not; I have not been constantly
with her for thirteen years; she may have taken food
in my absence. Her friends have used every device to make
her take nourishment. Food has been forced upon her, and
artificial means have been resorted to that it might be carried
to her stomach. Nevertheless, the amount in the aggregate
must have been very small in all these years.'</p>

<p>"'You have considered the case of such extraordinary importance
as to take many physicians to see it?'</p>

<p>"'I have, and it has excited very much of attention. I have
letters about it from far and near, and the medical journals
have asked for information.'"</p>

<p>And this with Dr. Ormiston:</p>

<p>"Dr. Robert Ormiston, who has been one of Miss Fancher's
physicians from the first, who has seen her constantly in all the
different conditions of her system, said yesterday that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
convinced that there could be no deception. He could find
no motive for it, and he did not believe that she had attempted
it. As to her not partaking of food, he had with Dr. Speir
made tests that satisfied him that she ate no more than she pretended
to, and in the aggregate it had not, in all these years,
amounted to more than the amount eaten at a single meal by a
healthy man. Dr. Ormiston narrated many curious incidents
of the girl's illness, and verified the facts of her physical condition
as narrated elsewhere."</p>

<p>In order that no injustice may be done to these gentlemen,
I quote the following from the <i>Sun</i> of November 26th:</p>

<p>"Dr. R. Fleet Speir, one of Miss Fancher's physicians,
smiled last evening when the <i>Sun</i> reporter asked him what he
thought of Dr. Hammond's opinions on the case. 'I probably
have just as high an opinion of Dr. Hammond's opinions
as Dr. Hammond has of mine,' he said. 'My opinion on the
case of Miss Fancher I have always refused to give to any one.
When I first took the case, years ago, I told the family that I
would not give them an opinion on it; that I would do what
I could with it, and that I hoped to bring about a cure. I do
not believe in clairvoyance or second sight, or anything of the
kind. I think I stand with the most rigid school on that subject.'</p>

<p>"'But do you think Miss Fancher deceives or endeavors
to?'</p>

<p>"The Doctor smiled again. 'Now I do not want you to interview
me on that. My theory has along been to do nothing
to irritate my patient; I humored her, and have endeavored in
that way to get her confidence, to get complete control of her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
if possible. In that way I may get her mind diverted, and by
and by get her out of bed. I have hoped to see her cured. I
do not see what earthly good a scientific investigation would
do her. On the contrary, it would harm her. Put a relay of
physicians to watch her, and she would undoubtedly do her
best to beat them. She would hold out against them, and
likely as not die.'</p>

<p>"Dr. Robert Ormiston said that he thought that the Brooklyn
physicians knew quite as much about the case as their New
York brethren, and that their opinions were of as much weight.
'It has become a most interesting case from a medical standpoint,
because during her long illness, she has gone through all
the different phases of hysteria that have heretofore been observed
in many different cases. I think I am correct in this
statement.'"</p>

<p>From all that can be ascertained therefore, it appears that
the young lady in question received a severe injury to the
spinal cord, in consequence of which she became paralyzed in
the lower extremities, in which members contractions also took
place. It is probable also that the great sympathetic nerve and
brain were involved in the injury.</p>

<p>Confined to her bed, her bodily temperature being low, and
passing a good of her time in trances or periods of insensibility,
the requirements of the system as regarded food would necessarily
be limited. But this is the most that can be said. She
<i>did</i> breathe, her heart <i>did</i> beat, she required <i>some</i> bodily heat,
and the various other functions of her organism could not have
been maintained without the expenditure of matter of some kind.
During abstinence from food the body itself is consumed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
these purposes, and there being no renovation, no supplies
from without, it loses weight with every instant of time until
death finally ensues. An emaciated person can withstand this
drain less effectually than one who is stout and fat.</p>

<p>Again, it is said that the food taken by Miss Fancher was at
once rejected. That it was <i>all</i> rejected, is in the highest degree
improbable; a portion remained, and this portion, small
as it was, did good service when very little was required.</p>

<p>Another point: that Miss Fancher was hysterical admits of
no doubt. Hysteria is a disease as much in some cases beyond
the control of the patient as inflammation of the brain or any
other disease. A proclivity to simulation and deception is just
as much a symptom of hysteria as pain is of pleurisy. To say,
therefore, that she simulated abstinence and deceived us to
the quantity of food she took, is no imputation on her honesty,
or questioning her possession of as high a degree of honor and
trust, as can be claimed by any one. Other women naturally
as moral as she, have under the influence of hysteria perpetrated
the grossest deceptions, and they are not unfrequently
manifested in the very same way that hers apparently are.
Her case is by no means an isolated one; it is not such as has
never been seen before; it does not "knock the bottom out of
all existing medical theories, and is in a word miraculous," as
one of the physicians is reported to have said. On the contrary,
similar ones are often met with as we have seen, and the
following which I quote from Millingen,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is so like it in many
respects, that the two might have been formed after a common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
model, as in fact they were, just as two or more cases of pneumonia
follow a well defined type.</p>

<p>"Another wonderful instance of the same kind is that of
Janet McLeod, published by Dr. McKenzie. She was at the
time thirty-three years of age, unmarried, and from the age of
fifteen had had various attacks of epilepsy, which had produced
so rigid a lock-jaw that her mouth could rarely be
forced open by any contrivance; she had lost very nearly the
power of speech and deglutition, and with this all desire to eat
or drink. Her lower limbs were contracted towards her body;
she was entirely confined to her bed, and had periodical discharges
of blood from the lungs, which were chiefly thrown out
by the nostrils. During a few intervals of relaxation she was
prevailed upon with great difficulty to put a few crumbs of
bread comminuted in the hand, into her mouth, together with a
little water sucked from her one hand, and, in one or two instances,
a little gruel, but even in these attempts almost the
whole was rejected. On two occasions also, after a total abstinence
of many months, she made signs of wishing to drink
some water, which was immediately procured for her. On the
first trial the whole seemed to be returned from the mouth, but
she was greatly refreshed in having it rubbed upon the throat.
On the second occasion she drank off a pint at once, but could
not be prevailed upon to drink any more, although her father
had now fixed a wedge between her teeth. With these exceptions,
however, she seemed to have passed upwards of four
years without either liquids or solids of any kind, or even an
appearance of swallowing; she lay for the most part like a log
of wood, with a pulse scarcely perceptible for feebleness, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
distinct and regular. Her countenance was clear and pretty
fresh; her features neither disfigured nor sunk; her bosom
round and prominent, and her limbs not emaciated. Dr. McKenzie
watched her, with occasional visits, for eight or nine
years, at the close of which period she seemed to be a little
improved."</p>

<p>This account, like that given of Miss Fancher, tells us nothing
definite in regard to the fasting abilities of the young woman.
It simply, with the other, may be accepted as indicating
that hysterical women are able to go for comparatively long
periods without food, and that fact we already knew. It will
be observed that it is stated that she "<i>seemed</i>" to go four years
without food or drink.</p>

<p>In regard to Miss Fancher, the evidence is a little conflicting.
First we have Dr. Speir reported as saying, in answer to
a question as to her having lived fourteen years without food:</p>

<p>"'Yes, she became my patient in 1864. Her case is a most
remarkable one.'</p>

<p>"'But has she eaten nothing during all these years?'</p>

<p>"'I can safely say she has not.'"</p>

<p>This in the <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>But about a month afterward we find the following conversation,
reported as taking place between the same physician
and another reporter, this time of the <i>Sun</i>:</p>

<p>"'Is it true that she has not partaken of food in all these
thirteen years?'</p>

<p>"'No, I cannot say that she has not; I have not been constantly
with her for thirteen years. She may have taken food
in my absence.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In which opinion all physiologists will join.</p>

<p>As I have said, hysterical women certainly do exhibit a
marked ability to go without both food and drink. I have had
patients abstain from sometimes one, sometimes the other, and
sometimes both, for periods varying from one day to eleven,
and this without much, if any, suffering, for as soon as the
suffering came they did not hesitate to signify their desire to
break their voluntary fasts. Real suffering is a condition
which the hysterical woman avoids with the most assiduous
care.</p>

<h3>THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF INANITION.</h3>

<p>The opinion that food and drink are necessary to life is so
generally accepted by mankind, that few venture to dispute the
dictum of Virchow relative to Louise Lateau, "Fraud or miracle."
But although it is impossible so far as we know for
individuals to continue to exist for months and years without
the ingestion of nutriment into the system, it is undoubtedly
true that under certain circumstances life can be prolonged for
days and weeks without any food of any kind going into the
organism.</p>

<p>The body is a machine constructed for the purpose of working.
The kinds of work which the body of a man or woman
does are many. Every act of perception or sensation, is an act
of work; so is every thought, every emotion, every volition.
The action of the heart or lungs in the circulation and respiration,
the evolution of the animal heat, the various functions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
secretion and excretion, digestion, motion, speech, etc., are all
so many kinds of work. Now as regards work, it is well known
that for its due performance force is required, and it is equally
well known that for the development of force, matter that can
be metamorphosed is necessary. The engine may be perfect,
the water may be in the boiler, but unless there be force in the
form of heat there will be no steam; and there will be no heat
unless there be fuel in a state of combustion.</p>

<p>The human body differs from any other machine in the fact
that it uses its fuel in great part indirectly; only in fact after it
has been assimilated and converted into tissues of various
kinds. Thus when a muscle contracts, it is the muscle itself
which is consumed; when a thought is conceived it is the brain
which provides the force; when an emotion is experienced, it
is again the brain which is decomposed. The body, therefore,
lives by the death of its own substance. It is true, some kinds
of food such as alcohol, tea and coffee, and perhaps some
others do not require to go farther than the blood to be
burned, but these are mainly heat-producing, and not tissue-producing
substances. But whether matter be consumed directly
or indirectly, all bodily force results from its decomposition,
and without this destruction of matter the body would be
absolutely incapable of a single functional action of any kind
whatever, and its temperature like that of the so-called cold-blooded
animals would be that of the surrounding medium, the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The quantity of food required by the system varies like the
demands of other machines in accordance with the amount of
work which is to be performed. A plowman, other things being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
equal, consumes more than a watchmaker; just as a locomotive
burns more fuel than the little engine that runs a sewing machine;
the strong able-bodied active man, one who works his
brains and muscles up to their full power, eats more than the
weak, emaciated and inactive girl, who passes all her time in
the recumbent position in bed; and the latter will, other things
being equal, endure for a longer period entire abstinence from
food. A little food with such a one goes a great way, the
demands of the system are at their minimum, and hence a
mouthful of bread, or a little tea and toast taken at long intervals,
suffices for the supply of all, or a great portion of the
waste of the body. With such a person there is not much intense
thought, there is little or no muscular action, the pulsations
of the heart do not require to be of much force, the respiration
is feeble, digestion is at its lowest point, there are no
great demands for animal heat, and in fact if the temperature
of the atmosphere of the room in which such a person lies, be
kept high, the function of calorification may be almost nothing.
Still there must be some food taken. The body, can to a certain
extent, be used up in supplying the force required for the several
functions without the necessity for an immediate restoration of
its tissues, but there is a limit to this, beyond which it is certain
death to go.</p>

<p>Chossat<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has determined this point very accurately by many
experiments performed upon doves, pigeons, Guinea pigs,
rabbits, etc. He found that as a mean result, death ensued
when the body lost four-tenths of its original weight. For instance,
a body weighing one hundred pounds, could endure the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
loss of forty pounds without death necessarily following. Five-tenths
or one-half appeared to be the extreme loss of weight in
inanition which the body could endure without death resulting.</p>

<p>In addition to the loss of weight the temperature fell rapidly,
the action of the heart was lessened, the number and depth of
the respirations was diminished, and the excretions gradually
became smaller in amount.</p>

<p>Experiments such as those of Chossat on the lower animals,
cannot of course be instituted on the human subject, nevertheless
nature sometimes performs experiments for us which are
not without valuable results; and accidents of various kinds,
have also given us important data.</p>

<p>On the 19th of March, 1755, twenty-two persons living in the
Alpine village of Bergemoletto, in Piedmont, were buried in
their houses by an avalanche or whirlwind of snow. The space
covered was about two hundred and seventy feet in length, sixty in
breadth, and the snow was over forty-two feet in depth. Notwithstanding
all the efforts made by the survivors it was impossible
to extricate the buried persons till the 18th of April following.
All were dead except three women, who, having found some
hay, fed a goat with it, and thus obtained from this animal a
pint of milk daily, on which they had managed to sustain life for
a month.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In Belgium in the year 1683, four colliers were confined in
a coal pit for twenty-four days without anything to eat. On the
twenty-fifth day they were taken out. In all that time they had
lived on nothing but a little water, which flowed from the walls
of the prison in which they were immured.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A case is mentioned by Foder&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> on the authority of M.
Chaussier, in which some workmen were taken out alive after
having been confined for fourteen days in a cold damp vault.
When released at the end of the time mentioned, their pulses
were slow and weak, their animal heat greatly reduced, and respiration
barely perceptible. Foder&eacute; ascribes their long existence
without either food or drink, to the fact that the atmosphere
of the vault was exceedingly humid, and that the moisture
was absorbed into their bodies, taking the place of water ingested
into the stomach.</p>

<p>In another case reported by Dr. Straus,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a man sixty-five
years of age, was extracted alive from a coal mine, in which he
had been imprisoned for twenty-three days. During the first
ten days he had a little dirty water, but for the last thirteen
days nothing whatever. When taken out he was in a condition
of great weakness and emaciation and died after three days,
notwithstanding all efforts made to preserve his life.</p>

<p>Cases of prolonged abstinence often occur among the insane,
who, under the influence of delusions, or in order to destroy
their lives refuse all food. Dr. Willan relates the case of a
young man, who, through delusions, refused all food but a little
orange juice, and who lived for sixty days on this alone.</p>

<p>Of course such persons, if under the observation of a physician,
could be fed forcibly, but through the ignorance of
friends or relatives it not unfrequently happens that medical
aid is not invoked in time, and serious symptoms, or even death
itself, may result. The time at which this last termination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ensues varies according to the kind of insanity with which the
patient is affected. A general paralytic deprived of all food
dies sooner than a healthy person. An insane person suffering
from acute mania also resists inanition badly, but one the subject
of melancholia often endures the total deprivation of aliment
for a long time. Esquirol<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> cites the case of a melancholic
who did not succumb till after eighteen days of complete
abstinence, and Desbarreaux-Bernard another in which life
was prolonged for sixty-one days, but in this case a little broth
was taken once. Desportes<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> refers to the case of a woman subject
to melancholia who continued to exist during two months
of abstinence, during which she took nothing into the stomach
but a little water.</p>

<p>It would be easy to go on and quote other instances occurring
among prisoners, shipwrecked persons, those suffering from
diseases which prevented food entering the stomach, others lost
in deserts, forests, etc., in which life has been prolonged for
considerable periods. Such cases are, however, quite exceptional.
An interesting instance occurring under one of these
heads may, however, be cited as an example.</p>

<p>M. L&eacute;pine<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> reports the case of a young girl nineteen years of
age who swallowed a quantity of sulphuric acid. As a consequence
a stricture of the &#339;sophagus was produced. Three
months after the act, liquids alone passed into the stomach;
emaciation was extreme and the countenance pallid. Four
months subsequently, that is, seven months after swallowing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
acid, the obliteration of the &#339;sophagus was complete, and nothing
whatever could be swallowed. The patient lived for sixteen
days after all food or drink was prevented reaching the stomach.
During the last days of her starvation she complained only of
thirst and not of hunger. The prostration was extreme and
the temperature greatly lessened. A tendency to sleep was
present, and there was a subdued delirium. On the last day of
life there was more excitement; the conjunctiv&aelig; were red, the
pulse thread-like, and the skin cold. It is not stated whether
or not attempts were made to feed this patient by injections
into the rectum of nutritious substances, or by the use of baths
containing such matters in solution. It may, however, safely
be taken for granted that efforts of these kinds were made, and
if so, the unusually long period during which life was sustained
is explained.</p>

<p>In all the cases in which life was extraordinarily prolonged
there was either not a total deprivation of food and drink, or there
was a state of muscular inaction present particularly favorable
to retardation of the destructive changes in the body which abstinence
produces. It may be asserted that in ordinary cases
absolute deprivation of food and drink cannot be endured by a
healthy adult longer than ten days, and death generally ensues
before the end of the eighth day. It is said that women sustain
abstinence better than men. Young persons and the aged
certainly resist with less power than those of the middle period
of life. Dante was aware of this fact when he made the children
of Ugolino die before their father, the youngest first, the
oldest last.</p>

<p>Even though there be a total deprivation of what may strictly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
be called food, some of the cases already cited show that if
water be taken life is preserved for a much longer period than
would otherwise be the case. Thus a negro woman, according
to Dr. J. W. Francis,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> believing herself to be bewitched, abstained
from food for three weeks, but during this period took
two small cups of water, to which a very little wine had been
added.</p>

<p>In a case reported by Dr. McNaughton<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> a longer resistance
was maintained.</p>

<p>"The subject of this case was a young man, aged twenty-seven,
who for three years immediately preceding his death
almost constantly kept his room, apparently engaged in meditation,
a Bible his only companion. At the latter end of May,
1829, his appetite began to fail; he ate very little, and on the
2d of July he declined eating altogether. For the first six
weeks of his fast he went regularly to the well, washed himself,
and took a bowl full of water with him into the house. With
this he occasionally washed his mouth and drank a little; the
quantity taken during the twenty-four hours did not exceed a
pint. On one occasion he went three days without taking
water, but on the fourth morning he was observed to go to the
well and drink copiously and greedily. For the first six weeks
he walked out every day, and sometimes spent the greater part
of the day in the woods. He retained his strength until a
short time before his death. During the first three weeks he
emaciated rapidly; afterwards he did not seem to waste so sensibly.
Prof. Willoughby visited him a few days before he died.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
He found the skin very cold, the respiration feeble and slow,
but otherwise natural; but the effluvia from the breath, and
perhaps the skin, were extremely offensive. During the greater
part of the latter week of his life the parents say there was a
considerable discharge of foul reddish matter from the lungs.
To this perhaps the offensive smell referred to may be chiefly
attributed. The pulse was regular, but slow and feeble, and
the arteries extremely contracted. The radial artery, for example,
could be distinctly felt like a small, hard thread, communicating
almost a wiry feel.</p>

<p>"The alvine evacuations were rare; it is believed that he
passed several weeks without any, but the secretion of urine
seemed more regular. He died after fasting fifty-three days.
On dissection the stomach was found loose and flabby. The
gall bladder was distended with a dark, muddy-looking bile.
The mesentery, stomach and intestines were excessively thin
and transparent. There was no fat in the omentum."</p>

<p>In cases of complete abstinence, the phenomena&mdash;to several
of which attention has already been called&mdash;are very striking.
The respiration becomes slow until just before death, when, as
Chossat observes, there is often a quickening of the respiratory
movements. The exhaled breath has a peculiarly sickening
and fetid odor. The pulse loses in force and frequency.</p>

<p>The blood becomes reduced in quantity to such an extent
sometimes that, as observed by Collard and Martigny,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> incisions
may be made in various parts of the bodies of animals suffering
from inanition without there being any h&aelig;morrhage.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>The animal temperature falls, according to Chossat, 8&deg; per
day until the day of death, when it reaches 14&deg;; and at the
moment life departs, the loss suddenly becomes 30&deg;.</p>

<p>All the secretions are diminished in quantity. This is especially
shown as regards the saliva and urine. Even open sores
cease to secrete pus.</p>

<p>At first there is pain, the seat of which is referred to the
stomach, and which pain in the beginning, being simply a feeling
of emptiness, rapidly assumes a gnawing or tearing character.
But before long this fades away and it does not appear
that in the middle and final stages of inanition there is any
suffering which can be called a pain, or which can be fixed in
any definite part of the body.</p>

<p>The mental faculties are profoundly affected. A high state
of delirium supervenes, and there are often hallucinations.
These sometimes relate to food, which appears to the sufferer
to be spread out before him in the most seducing manner. All
nobility of character disappears, and selfishness and brutality
govern. Finally the delirium becomes low and muttering, the
bodily weakness becomes excessive, walking, or even standing,
is impossible, the sufferer loses all sensation, and death ensues.</p>

<p>But probably no part of the subject is of more interest than
that which relates to the association of inanition with hysteria.
As is well known by physicians, the existence of this latter condition
enables many to bear partial, or even complete deprivation
of food longer and with less apparent suffering than would
be possible with individuals in good health.</p>

<p>That Miss Fancher is subject to hysteria is very evident from
a consideration of the clinical history of her case, and hence it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is to be expected that she can endure long fasts without much
inconvenience. It is just possible that she might, by remaining
quietly in bed in a state of partial or complete trance&mdash;a hysterical
condition in which the waste of the tissues is greatly reduced&mdash;exist
for a month without either food or drink, and
therefore the proposition which I made to her friends contains
no exacting condition. But when it is gravely said that "for a
period of nearly fourteen years she has lived absolutely without
food or nourishment of any kind," we are forced to declare, in
the interest of science, that the statement is necessarily absolutely
devoid of truth. Subsequent statements, as we have
seen, modify this fourteen years' claim very materially, and
really leave it in doubt whether there was any abstinence at
all.</p>

<p>But I think it may safely be believed that Miss Fancher has
indulged in frequent long fasts. Hysteria is very frequently
marked, not only by the ability to endure lengthened periods
of abstinence, but by the abolition of all desire for food, to
such an extent that the sight or even idea of aliment of any
kind excites loathing and disgust. M. Las&egrave;gue,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in a very interesting
memoir, has discussed this part of the subject with
great precision, and has shown that though such patients take
very little food they do take some, and that eventually they experience
all the symptoms of inanition. He has never seen
death result from the abstinence, for as soon as the condition
becomes decidedly unpleasant the patient resumes gradually
her normal alimentation.</p>

<p>In a case recently under my care, a young lady twenty-three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
years of age became hysterical in consequence of domestic
troubles, and losing all desire for food, took nothing daily but a
single cup of chocolate. She persevered in this restricted diet for
twenty-nine days, although during the last eight or ten she gave
decided evidences of starvation. She became emaciated, her
temperature fell, especially in the extremities, her breath was
offensive, her menstruation ceased, and there was such a marked
sense of discomfort that she began to crave food, not, as she
said, because her appetite had returned, but because she was
afraid she would die. Still she resisted till, on the thirtieth
day, she begged for a little beef tea, and from that moment her
appetite returned to her, and by the end of another week, she
was eating her ordinary quantity and variety of food.</p>

<p>Now, in this case, though the amount of nutriment taken
daily was small, it was of such a character as to be well able to
sustain life. The half pint of chocolate contained milk and
sugar, besides the highly nutritious chocolate, with its carbonaceous
and nitrogenous matters, and yet a month was the extreme
limit of endurance.</p>

<p>That a state of inanition exists in Miss Fancher is not to be
doubted. The extreme emaciation, the reduced bodily temperature,
the contracted stomach and intestines, the great bodily
weakness, all show that she is not sufficiently nourished. In
her case there is apparently not only an absence of appetite but
a positive disgust for food; and another symptom often present
in inanition&mdash;vomiting when nutriment is taken into the
stomach&mdash;appears also to be a prominent feature. It is probable
that there is likewise a notable diminution in the amount of
urine excreted, as this is a common accompaniment of hysterical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
manifestations such as hers. In some instances the function
appears to be almost entirely arrested, as was the fact in a case
described by M. Charcot,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and in two which have come under
my own observation.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable in the admitted fact that Miss
Fancher eats very little. We have seen how existence can be
kept up on greatly reduced quantities of food, and under circumstances
such as those governing her case, for periods which
would be impossible in healthy persons. No one yet under any
conditions, whether of hysteria or trance or assumed miraculous
interference, has, to the satisfaction of competent and disinterested
investigators, lived even two months without the ingestion
of any food whatever. As to going nearly fourteen years in a
state of abstinence&mdash;a statement in her behalf which many
persons believe to be true&mdash;I can only say that all the teachings
of science and of experience are against the claim. No one
who had the most superficial idea of what knowledge is and
how facts can be proven, would for a moment accept such a
preposterous story, no matter by whom asserted.</p>

<p>The whole subject is one which is to be examined into and
determined like any other matter, and yet, when a proposition
is made to investigate by skilled observers the remarkable claim
put forward, it is met with abuse and misrepresentation, as if
these people thought that all they had to do was to make an
assertion of a phenomenon which, according to what we know
of nature, is absurd and impossible, to have it at once accepted
by those who know, by painful experience, how doubtful all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
things are till they are proven, and how difficult it is to get
satisfactory evidence of the most simple event in physiology or
pathology. No one doubts the abstract possibility of a human
being living without food, for, bearing in mind the discoveries
that are constantly being made, nothing can be regarded as absolutely
impossible outside the domain of mathematics. Two
and two cannot make six, neither can two distinct bodies occupy
the same space at the same time, nor the square of the
hypothenuse be otherwise than equal to the sum of the squares
of the other two sides of a right-angled triangle.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of natural science is, however, founded on experience.
Looking at a bear, for instance, for the first time, and
with no knowledge of its habits and capacities we would not be apt
to believe that the animal could go into retirement at the beginning
of winter and remain till spring in a condition of semi-existence
and without food. But experience teaches us that
the bear when it begins to hibernate is fat; that during hibernation
it is in a perfectly quiescent state; that when it emerges
into active life again it is emaciated, and that during the whole
period of retirement it has taken nothing into its stomach. We
then know by observing that all bears go through the same
process, that it is a law of their organism to do so, and that
their reduced functional actions are maintained by the consumption
of the fat with which in the beginning their bodies
were loaded. Even here, then, there is no exception to the law
that there is no force without the decomposition of matter.
Now, it is just possible that by some hitherto unknown or unrecognized
condition of the system a man or woman may obtain
the force necessary to carry on life for fourteen years without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
getting it through food taken into the stomach. But a
possibility and a fact are two very different things, and the admitted
possibility has not yet been shown to be a fact. It is
easier&mdash;to use the argument of Hume&mdash;for the mind to accept
the view that there is deception or error somewhere, than to
believe that a woman, contrary to all human experience, should
live fourteen years without food. Turtles, we know, will live for
months while entirely deprived of nutriment. Many others of
the cold-blooded animals will do the same thing. It is their
nature to do so, and we have experience of the fact, but it is
not the nature of women, so far as we know, and therefore we
refuse to accept as true the stories which are told of their powers
in this direction. And our knowledge is based not only on our
daily experience of the wants of their systems and the examples
of starvation which have come to our knowledge, but also
upon the fact that in the many cases of alleged long abstinence
from food that have been investigated, error or deception has
been discovered. Therefore, when it is said that Miss Fancher
lives without food, and has so done for fourteen years, we simply
say, "give us the proofs." Of course the proofs are not given.</p>

<p>How far Miss Fancher is responsible for the assertions that
have been made in regard to her long-continued abstinence I
do not know. A tendency to deception is a notable phenomenon
of hysteria, and if she has led those about her to accept
the view that she has existed without food for years, the circumstance
would be in no way remarkable. Other hysterical
women have deceived in the same or in still more astonishing
ways. Or it may be that the amount of food taken being very
small, carelessness or want of exactness has led to the expression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that she lived upon "absolutely nothing," just as we hear
the words used every day by those who have little or no
appetite, but who nevertheless do eat something. Again, a love
for the marvellous is so deeply rooted in the average human
mind that it willingly, and to a certain extent unconsciously,
adds to any statement of a remarkable circumstance, till the
latter grows, whilst being repeated, to fabulous dimensions.</p>

<p>But however this may be, whatever the explanation, it is
quite certain that if Miss Fancher has lived fourteen years
without food, or even fourteen months, or weeks, she is a unique
psychological or pathological individual, whose case is worthy
of all the consideration which can be given to it, not by superstitious
or credulous or ignorant persons, but by those who,
trained in the proper methods of scientific research, would
know how to get the whole truth of her case, and nothing but
the truth. It is to be regretted, therefore, that the proposition
contained in the annexed letter (<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>) was not accepted,
and that we are forced to place Miss Fancher's case among
the others which have proved to be fallacious, till such time as
it may suit her and her friends to allow of such an examination.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>The following letter embraces the proposition made to Miss
Fancher, to which allusion is made in the text:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">To The Editor of the Herald</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have read the letter of Professor Henry M. Parkhurst, published in a
recent issue of the <span class="smcap">Herald</span>, relative to the "mind reading" or clairvoyance
of Miss Mollie Fancher, of Brooklyn, and it does not satisfy me that the
young lady in question possesses any such power. It would have been very
easy for her to have opened the envelope without disturbing the seal and to
have read the contents. Now, there has been a great deal of talk about
Miss Fancher's case. I have received just fifty-seven letters asking me to
investigate it, and the press has reiterated the invitation over and over
again. I have stated very explicitly that I regard the whole matter as a
humbug of the most decided kind, but I have never asserted the impossibility
of the young lady's alleged performances. On the contrary, I hold
nothing to be absolutely impossible outside the domain of mathematics.
But possibilities and realities are very different things, and I certainly will
not accept as true any such phenomena as those asserted to have been associated
with Miss Fancher unless they are proven.</p>

<p>I have already declared my readiness to investigate Miss Fancher, and, a
few days since, in the <i>Sun</i>, proposed a test which will be perfectly satisfactory
to me and many others who, at present, are in accordance with me in
my estimation of this young lady. Permit me now to state it definitely,
specifically, and once for all. I will place a certified check for a sum of
money exceeding $1,000 inside of a single paper envelope. I will lay the
package on a table in the room in which she is. If she chooses she may
take it in her hands and place it in contact with any part of her body. I
will allow her half an hour to describe the check. If she reads it&mdash;number,
date, on whom drawn, amount, signature, etc.&mdash;accurately, she may have
the check as her own property, or I will give the amount expressed in the
check, in her name to any charitable institution she may designate, or otherwise
dispose of it in accordance with her wishes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The only conditions I exact are these:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;That the experiment be conducted in my presence and in that of
two other physicians, members of the New York Neurological Society,
whom I will bring with me as witness simply, and who will not interfere in
any way with the test.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;That the envelope shall at no time pass out of our sight.</p>

<p>If Miss Fancher succeeds in this test I will admit that heretofore in my
denunciations of such performances as hers I have been in error, and that
there is a force in nature which ought to be investigated. I will pay the
money not only without chagrin, but with great satisfaction, and will consider
that I have received full value.</p>

<p>If she fails, as I am quite sure she will, I shall not hesitate to continue
to denounce her as an imposition in this as well as in her assumed abstinence
from food.</p>

<p>A word further in regard to this last matter. I know something about
"fasting girls" and their frauds, not excepting the sad case of poor little Sarah
Jacob. But I will make this additional proposition:&mdash;If Miss Fancher will
allow herself to be watched, day and night, for one month, by relays of
members of the New York Neurological Society, I will give her $1,000 if
at the end of that month she has not in the meantime taken food voluntarily
or as a forced measure to save her from dying of starvation, the danger of
this last contingency to be judged of by her family physician, Dr. Speir.
These offers to remain open for acceptance till twelve o'clock M., December
31st. If not taken up by that time, let us hear no more in support of
Miss Fancher's mind reading or clairvoyance, or living for a dozen or more
years without food.</p>
